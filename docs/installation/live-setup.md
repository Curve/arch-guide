# Live Setup

At this point, I assume you're already in the archiso. Make sure you are using the latest version which can be found on the [official download site](https://www.archlinux.org/download/)

## Set keyboard layout

‚å®Ô∏è The default keymap is US. Available layouts can be listed with:

```bash
ls /usr/share/kbd/keymaps/**/*.map.gz
```

Set your keymap (replace `yourkeymap` with your keymap e.g. `de-latin1`)

```bash
loadkeys yourkeymap
```

## If you use Wi-Fi to connect to your router

üì∂ Use this tool to connect to your network

```bash
iwctl
device list
# your device name might be different (replace wlan0)
station wlan0 scan
station wlan0 get-networks
# replace <SSID> with your network name from the previous command
station wlan0 connect <SSID>
exit
```

## Check internet connection

```bash
ping -c 3 archlinux.org
```

## Sync time

üïí Ensure the system clock is accurate

```bash
timedatectl set-ntp true
```

## Check if booted in BIOS or UEFI

```bash
ls /sys/firmware/efi/efivars
```

If the directory does not exist, the system may be booted in Legacy BIOS Mode.
Most likely you want to do a UEFI install so please double-check if your system supports UEFI and you selected the correct entry in the boot menu (In most cases prefixed with UEFI)
